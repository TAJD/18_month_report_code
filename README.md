# 18_month_report_code
Code used to support my 18 month thesis can be found in this repository: https://github.com/TAJD/sail_routing/tree/development

This readme is used to draw attention to different aspects of the code that are used in the 18 month report.

1. A dynamic programming implementation of the minimum time routing problem is found in https://github.com/TAJD/sail_routing/tree/master/routing/SailReRo
1. Scripts used to study the influence of different assumptions regarding weather and performance uncertainty are found in https://github.com/TAJD/sail_routing/tree/development/routing/time_dependent_analysis.
